# Package details

* Package name
* CRAN URL - Only packages that are already available on CRAN will be considered.

**Note:**
This is a volunteer run project and some packages can be difficult to build. This means that it can take some time to review and respond to requests and in some circumstances, it may not be possible to provide a pre-built binary for a given package. Naturally you can still use the official CRAN source distribution to install the package yourself.
